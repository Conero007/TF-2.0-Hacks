This respository contains my exploration of the newly released [TensorFlow 2.0 beta](http://tensflow.org/beta/) (2.0.0-beta1 at this point in time :P). TensorFlow team introduced a lot of new and useful changes in this release; automatic mixed precision training, flexible custom  training, distributed GPU training, enhanced ops for the high-level Keras API are some of my personal favorites. 
You can see all of the new changes [here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPweUtct2yY). The library is now truly easy to use and very readable.
