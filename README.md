This respository contains my exploration of the newly released [TensorFlow 2.0 alpha](http://tensflow.org/alpha/). TensorFlow team introduced a lot of new and useful changes in this release; automatic mixed precision training, custom and imperative training, distributed GPU training, enhanced ops for the high-level Keras API are some of my personal favorites. 
You can see all of the new changes [here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPweUtct2yY). The library is now truly easy to use and very readable. 

**Note** the Universal Sentence Encoder example (using `tf_hub`) is based on TensorFlow 1.13.1 because 2.0's GPU variant is still inconsistent with `tf_hub.` As soon as I get to know about a fix, I will update it accordingly.
