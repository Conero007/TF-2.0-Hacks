This respository contains my exploration of the newly released [TensorFlow 2.0 alpha](http://tensflow.org/alpha/). TensorFlow team introduced a lot of new and useful changes in this releases; automatic mixed precision training, custom and imperative training, distributed GPU training, enhanced ops for the high-level Keras API are some of my personal favorites. 
You can see all of the new changes [here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPweUtct2yY). The library is now truly easy to use and very readable. 

Currently, the repository is pretty empty, just contains one experiment. But I will give it a time to thoroughly grasp the stuff the team at TensorFlow has built (at least from a practitioner's point of view).
